=== Scale Minimum

[cols="a",options="unnumbered,noheader"]
|===
| [underline]#IHO Definition:# The minimum scale at which the feature
may be used for example for ECDIS presentation.

Value Type: integer

[underline]#Indication:# The modulus of the scale is indicated, that
is stem:[1:89999] is encoded as 89999

[underline]#Example:# If a particular minimum scale is specified as
stem:[1:89999] (encoded as 89999), and an example of a smaller scale
would be 1:179 999 (encoded as *179999*).

The *scale minimum* value of a feature determines the display scale
below which the feature is no longer displayed. Its purpose is to
reduce clutter, to prioritise the display of features and to improve
display speed. In encoding its value, the producing authority should
consider these factors, as well as the scale at which the feature
is no longer likely to be required for navigation.

In order to optimise the performance and clarity of the ENC, it is
a mandatory requirement on ENCs that *scale minimum* is used.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* *scale minimum* only affects the display of a feature on an ECDIS,
not its presence in the SD.

* If scale *minimum* is not encoded, the feature is displayed at all
scales.

* Where *scale minimum* is used, it must always be set to a scale
less (that is, to a smaller scale) than or equal to the maximum display
scale of the data.  Failure to follow this rule will mean that features
will not be displayed on the ECDIS until the overscale warning is
activated.

* [strkike]#Skin of the Earth and Meta features must always be displayed.
Therefore, *scale minimum* must not be encoded on Skin of the Earth
and Meta features.# (S-131 does not define skin of the earth features.)

* If the same feature exists in datasets of different maximum display
scales, the same *scale minimum* value must be assigned to each occurrence
of the feature.

=== Sector Bearing

[cols="a",options="unnumbered,noheader"]
|===
| [underline]#IHO Definition:# A sector is the part of a circle between
two straight lines drawn from the centre to the circumference. Sector
bearing specifies the limit of the sector.

Value Type: real

[underline]#Remarks:#

The values given to the common limits of adjacent sectors should be
identical. The orientation of bearing is from seaward to the central
object. This conforms with the method used in 'List of Lights' publications.
A generic term such as 'to shore' cannot be used; a specific bearing
must be encoded. Where a light sector limit is defined as
'to the shore', it should be encoded using a value that ensures that,
when the limit is drawn, it will fall entirely on land.

usually used for warships. (Merchant ships are usually measured based
on the volume of cargo space; see tonnage). Displacement is expressed
either in long tons of 2,240 pounds or metric tonnes of 1,000 kg.
Since the two units are very close in size (2,240 pounds = 1,016 kg
and 1,000 kg = 2,205 pounds), it is common not to distinguish between
them. To preserve secrecy, nations sometimes misstate a warship's
displacement.

=== Vessels Characteristics Unit

[cols="a",options="unnumbered,noheader"]
|===
| [underline]#IHO Definition:# The unit used for vessel characteristics
attribute.

. *Metric Ton*
+
--
[underline]#IHO Definition:# The tonne or metric ton (U.S.), often
redundantly referred to as a metric tonne, is a unit of mass equal
to 1,000 kg (2,205 lb) or approximately the mass of one cubic metre
of water at four degrees Celsius. It is sometimes abbreviated as mt
in the United States, but this conflicts with other SI symbols. The
tonne is not a unit in the International System of Units (SI), but
is accepted for use with the SI. In SI units and prefixes, the tonne
is a megagram (Mg). The Imperial and US customary units comparable
to the tonne are both spelled ton in English, though they differ in
mass. Pronunciation of tonne (the word used in the UK) and ton is
usually identical, but is not too confusing unless accuracy is important
as the tonne and UK long ton differ by only 1.6.
--

. *Ton*
+
--
[underline]#IHO Definition:# Long ton (weight ton or imperial ton)
is the name for the unit called the "ton" in the avoirdupois or Imperial
system of measurements, as used in the United Kingdom and several
other Commonwealth countries. It has been mostly replaced by the tonne,
and in the United States by the *short ton*. One long ton is equal
to 2,240 pounds (1,016 kg) or 35 cubic feet (0.9911 m) of salt water
with a density of 64 lb/ft (1.025 g/ml). It has some limited use in
the United States, most commonly in measuring the displacement of
ships, and was the unit prescribed for warships by the Washington
Naval Treaty for example battleships were limited to a mass of 35,000
long tons (36,000 t; 39,000 ST).
--

. *Short Ton*
+
--
[underline]#IHO Definition:# A unit of weight equal to 2,000 pounds
(907.18474 kg). In the United States it is often called simply ton
without distinguishing it from the metric ton (tonne, 1,000 kilograms)
or the long ton (2,240 pounds / 1,016.0469088 kilograms); rather,
the other two are specifically noted. There are, however, some US
applications for which unspecified tons normally means long tons (for
example, Navy ships) or metric tons (world grain production figures).
Both the long and short ton are defined as 20 hundredweights, but
a hundredweight is 100 pounds (45.359237 kg) in the US system (short
or net hundredweight) and 112 pounds (50.80234544 kg) in the Imperial
system (long or gross hundredweight).
--

. *Gross Ton*
+
--
[underline]#IHO Definition:# Gross tonnage (GT) is a function of the
volume of all ship's enclosed spaces (from keel to funnel) measured
to the outside of the hull framing. There is a sliding scale factor.
So GT is a kind of capacity-derived index that is used to rank a ship
for purposes of determining manning, safety and other statutory requirements
and is expressed simply as GT, which is a unitless entity, even though
its derivation is tied to the cubic meter unit of volumetric capacity.

Tonnage measurements are now governed by an IMO Convention (International
Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969 (London-Rules)),
which applies to all ships built after July 1982. In accordance with
the Convention, the correct term to use now is GT, which is a function
of the moulded volume of all enclosed spaces of the ship.
--

. *Net Ton*
+
--
[underline]#IHO Definition:# Net tonnage (NT) is based on a calculation
of the volume of all cargo spaces of the ship. It indicates a vessels
earning space and is a function of the moulded volume of all cargo
spaces of the ship.
--

. *Suez Canal Net Tonnage*

[underline]#IHO Definition:# The Suez Canal Net Tonnage (SCNT) is
derived with a number of modifications from the former net register
