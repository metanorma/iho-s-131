== Physical Infrastructure

[[sec_7.1]]
=== Introduction

Physical infrastructure features describe the infrastructural facilities
of the harbour area. They include floating and dry docks, gridirons,
ship lifts, and straddle carriers.

Note that the current model models ship lifts and straddle carriers
using the feature *HarbourFacility*, due to GI Registry conceptual
limitations on re-use of concepts.

All infrastructure features in S-131 carry a vertical clearance attribute,
inherited from the abstract type *HarbourPhysicalInfrastructure*.
The features are depicted in <<fig_7.1>> below. In addition, they
inherit the attributes and associations of higher-level supertypes
*FeatureType*, *OrganizationContactArea*, and *SupervisedArea*.

==== General

A dry dock (or graving dock) is an artificial basin into which a ship
can be floated for cleaning and repairs. The entrance can be closed
by gate or caisson and the water pumped out to expose the vessel's
bottom.

In S-101, a dry dock must also be covered by the S-101 LandArea feature.
The boundary of a dry dock is not encoded as a separate Coastline
or Shoreline Construction feature, except for the gate feature (Gate),
which may be encoded.

S-131 dry docks may therefore be superimposed on ENC LandArea features.
The Gate boundary in the underlying S-101 ENC should be included in
the surface spatial primitive of the S-131 *DockArea*.

8+| [underline]#IHO Definition:# A form of dry dock consisting of
a floating structure of one or more sections which can be partly submerged
by controlled flooding to receive a vessel, then raised by pumping
out the water so that the vessel's bottom can be exposed.

[[sec_7.3.1]]
==== General

In S-101, a Floating Dock feature must also be covered by Depth Area,
Dredged Area or Unsurveyed Area features. The boundary of a Floating
Dock feature of type surface is not be encoded as a separate feature
(Coastline or Shoreline Construction). S-131 encoders should therefore
verify that an S-131 *FloatingDock* is covered by an S-101 feature
of the appropriate type in an underlying S-101 ENC. If a discrepancy
is detected an attempt should be made to reconcile it.

The S-131 *FloatingDock* feature allows encoding of the sill depth
for the dock as a real attribute.
