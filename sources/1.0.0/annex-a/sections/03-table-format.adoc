| association, aggregation, or composition | Name
| The name of the feature class (same as at the head of this table).
| Role of this class.  |

| Name of the other class to which this class is linked.
| Role of the other class.  |

8+| If the class, role, and multiplicity for one end are missing,
it means the association is unidirectional, that is, the binding for
the association is only in one of the participating features or information
types. This is sometimes the case for information associations that
link a feature to an information type - the feature type has a binding
to the information type, but not vice versa.

[underline]#INT 1 Reference:# The INT 1 location(s) of the Feature
-- by INT1 Section and Section Number (if applicable).

*X.X.X Sub-clause heading(s) (see S-4 -- B-YYY.Y)*

Introductory remarks. Includes information regarding the real world
entity/situation requiring the encoding of the Feature in the ENC,
and where required nautical cartographic principles relevant to the
Feature to aid the compiler in determining encoding requirements.

Specific instructions to encode the feature.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Additional encoding guidance relevant to the feature.

*X.X.X.X Sub-sub-clause heading(s) (see S-4 -- B-CCC.C)*

Clauses related to specific encoding scenarios for the Feature (if required).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Additional encoding guidance relevant to the scenario (if required).

[underline]#Distinction:# List of features in the Product Specification
distinct from the Feature.

[underline]#Remarks:#

The clause references in the super-type and sub-types fields should
be hyperlinks when this DCEG is published, allowing navigation back
and forth between a feature type and its super-type. This can be used
to access guidance encoded in the feature table for a feature's super-types.

S-131 Attribute: Indentation of attributes indicates sub-attributes
of complex attributes. Complex attributes may also be sub-attributes
of complex attributes, which is indicated by further indentation of
the attribute name in the tables. Inherited attributes are not shown
in the table, only locally defined attributes.

S-131 Attribute: Attributes shown in grey text are ECDIS "system"
attributes which are not visible to the encoder, but are populated
by the ENC production system in order to assist with portrayal of
ENC data in ECDIS. (Note: Retained for compatibility with S-101. S-131
Edition 1.0 does not use system attributes.)

S-57 Acronym: S-57 attribute acronyms shown in italic style text have
been re-modelled in S-101 from S-57.

Allowable Encoding Value: For (EN) type attributes, the enumerates
listed are only those allowable for the particular occurrence of the
attribute relevant to the feature. Allowable values may vary for the
attribute depending on the feature to which the attribute is bound.
Such bindings are defined in the S-131 Feature Catalogue. The full
list of enumerates that may be assigned to an attribute in S-131 can
be found in the Simple Attributes section of the printed feature catalogue
document.

Type: The prefix pass-format:metanorma[(C)] indicates that the attribute
is a complex attribute. Complex attributes are aggregates of other
attributes that can be simple type or complex type (see Product Specification
main document <<sec_7.3>>). The prefix (S) indicates that the attribute
is a sub-attribute of a complex attribute. Complex attributes that
are sub-attributes of a complex attribute, and their sub-attributes,
are indicated by indentation of the attribute name in the S-131 Attribute
column.

Introductory clauses may depict associations using a UML diagram showing
the relationships that apply to the class and its super-classes
(generalizations). Relationships which are inherited from super-classes
are shown by including the super-classes and their associations in
the diagram.

The usual UML conventions apply. For explanations of standard UML
notations, see S-100 Part 1. For explanations of the conventions used
for associations, see <<sec_2.5>> in this DCEG.

Association ends and multiplicities: A lower bound of 0 in the multiplicity
at any end of an association indicates only that the association is
not mandatory for any particular instance of the feature at the other
end (i.e., it is not mandatory for an instance of "that" feature type
to have an association to a feature of "this" type). A lower bound
of "1" means that if an instance of "that" type exists, it must be
associated to an instance of "this" type. If the association is actually
encoded then it amounts to saying that "this relationship exists between
these two instances" and there must be an appropriate feature instance
at both ends. Associations that are not mandatory should be encoded
if and only if they convey useful information.
