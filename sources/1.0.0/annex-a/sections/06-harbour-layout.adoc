== Harbour Layout

[[sec_6.1]]
=== Introduction

Layout features describe the layout of the harbour area. They include
terminal, mooring facilities, special areas within the harbour, berths,
designation of the positioning of specific berths along a wharf or
quay, dock areas, and a *HarbourAreaSection* feature for subdividing
harbour areas into sub-sections.

Note that the current model includes some features which would ideally
be merged into "categoryOfPortSection" attributes of other features,
due to GI Registry conceptual limitations on re-use of concepts.

Port sections in S-131 include both water and land sections.

The most common water sections in ports are:

* Anchorage: An area in which vessels anchor or may anchor (NP100)
* Fairway: The main navigable channel in the approaches to, or within,
a river or harbour. Sometimes called the Ship Channel (NP100)
* Turning basin: An area of water or enlargement of a channel in a
port, where vessels are enabled to turn, and which is kept clear of
obstructions such as buoys for that purpose (NP100)
* Basin: A sheltered body of water available for port operations connecting
either with the sea, with an outer port or with another basin. Generally
an almost land locked area leading off an in inlet, firth or sound.
Also, an area of water limited in extent and nearly enclosed by structures
alongside which vessels can lie (IHO S-32)
* Berth Pocket: Body of water at the berth or anchor berth with sufficient
footprint to allow the vessel to make fast to the shore or mooring
buoys or to anchor (NP100).

Land or mixed land/water sections include:

* Terminals: A number of berths grouped together and provided with
facilities for handling cargo (IHO S-32)
* Berths, quays, wharfs, and mooring facilities: Places where vessels
may make fast for the purpose of loading or unloading cargo, embarking
or disembarking passengers, etc.
* Service locations: Dock areas, locations for removal of pollutants,
fueling, repairs, etc.

Different sections may under the immediate control of different organizations
or served by different operators. Terminal facilities are often owned
and/or operated by private companies. The overall harbour area is
therefore generally divisible into different sections, each of which
may be further divided into sub-sections or contain specific types
or areas or facilities.

<<fig_6.1>> depicts the logical hierarchy of layout feature types
in S-131, showing what attributes are bound to each type along with
their supertypes, from which they inherit attributes and associations.

==== Layout container associations

<<fig_6.2>> depicts the containment (spatial) hierarchy, with containment
relationships between layout feature types indicating which features
are spatially contained within and part of a larger feature.

*HarbourAreaAdministrative* is the main feature that covers the whole
port area. It is subdivided into zero or more sections modelled by
*HarbourAreaSection* features (the *LayoutDivision*) aggregation.
*HarbourAreaSection* can be further subdivided into *WaterwayArea*,
*Terminal*, *Berth*, *AnchorageArea*, *DockArea*, etc. The *Terminal*
feature can also be subdivided into *Berth* features using the same
association.

*HarbourAreaSection* can also be subdivided into further features
of the same class (the *SubUnit* self-association role).

Note that *HarbourAreaSection* features can contain other *HarbourAreaSection*
features. Note also that a *Terminal* can contain any number of *Berth*
features.

[[sec_6.1.2]]
==== Positioning in berths

Positions in a berth can be indicated by means of the *BerthPosition*
feature. Mooring facilities for anchor berths or at particular positions
can be linked with either *AnchorBerth* or *BerthPosition* features
with the _PrimaryAuxiliaryFacility_ association. These relationships
are depicted in <<fig_6.3>>.

[[fig_6.3]]
.Positions within berths and mooring facilities

[[sec_6.1.3]]
==== Associations for layout features

<<fig_6.4>> depicts all associations between layout features.

Nominal positions of berths can be indicated by associating a *BerthPosition*
feature to *Berth* using the *Demarcation* association.

Berth positions and Anchor berths can be linked to a mooring facility
using the *PrimaryAuxiliaryFacility* association.

The outer limit of the whole harbour area can be associated to *HarbourAreaAdministrative* feature using a *JurisdictionalLimit* association.

.Feature associations for non-abstract layout features

[[sec_6.1.4]]
==== Associations between layout and physical infrastructure features

Physical infrastructure features in a Terminal or *HarbourAreaSection*
feature should be linked to a containing *Terminal* or *HarbourAreaSection*
by an *Infrastructure* association (<<fig_6.5>>). If there is an hierarchy
of features containing the infrastructure only the feature at the
lowest level of the hierarchy should be linked to the infrastructure
feature.

[[fig_6.5]]

[[sec_6.1.5]]
==== Inheritance of _TextAssociation_ by all layout and physical infrastructure features

In addition, all layout and physical infrastructure features inherit
a _TextAssociation_ to the cartographic feature *TextPlacement* (<<fig_6.6>>).

[[sec_6.2.1]]
==== General

The *AnchorBerth* feature in S-131 omits several of the attributes
of the S-101 equivalent.

The positions or limits of anchor berths may be defined by a regulatory
authority (for example harbour authority).

[[sec_6.2.2]]
==== Anchor berths with limitations or restrictions on their use

If it is required to encode an anchorage with conditions on its use
related to the characteristics of a vessel or its cargo, it must be
done using an associated *Applicability* information type. If it is
required to encode an anchorage with other types of limitations on
its use (not pertaining to vessel or cargo characteristics), for example
an anchorage which may be used for a limited period of time, it must
be done using an associated *Restrictions* information type. The specific
limitation must be encoded in one or more attributes of the Restrictions
object.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The inherited complex attribute _featureName_, sub-attribute _name_
is used to encode the name and/or number of the anchor berth.
* Unlike S-101, S-131 does not include Sea Area/Named Water Area feature
types, so the name of a group of anchor berths known by a single common
name, must be encoded in each *AnchorBerth*.
* If an anchor berth is defined by a centre point and a swinging circle,
it should be encoded as a point in S-131 since the radius attribute
of S-101 is not included in S-131. The radius must be encoded in the
_textContent_ complex attribute with the headline "Swinging Circle"

[[sec_6.3.1]]
==== General

The *AnchorageArea* feature in S-131 omits several of the attributes
of the S-101 equivalent.

The complex attribute _featureName_, sub-attribute _name_ is used
to encode the name and/or number of the Anchorage Area.

The complex attribute _textContent_ may be used to provide information
about the category of anchorage, where required.

Individual recommended anchorages without defined limits should be
encoded as *AnchorageArea* features with _point_ spatial primitives.
Areas with numerous small craft moorings may be encoded as *AnchorageArea*
features of type surface.

[[sec_6.3.2]]
==== Regulations, depth information, and general textual information

General port regulations about anchorage areas in the port area may
be encoded in an associated *Regulations* information type.

The complex attribute _depthsDescription_ must be used for encoding
information about the depth of the anchorage, including for example
the nature of the seabed, shoaling, etc.

Other general textual information may be encoded in an associated
*NauticalInformation* information type, if pertaining to more than
one feature, or in the _textContent_ attribute, if pertinent to a
particular anchorage.

[[sec_6.3.3]]
==== Anchorages with limitations or restrictions on their use

If it is required to encode an anchorage with conditions on its use
related to the characteristics of a vessel or its cargo, it must be
done using an associated *Applicability* information type.

If it is required to encode an anchorage with other types of limitations
on its use (not pertaining to vessel or cargo characteristics), for
example an anchorage which may be used for a limited period of time,
it must be done using an associated *Restrictions* information type.
The specific limitation must be encoded in one or more attributes
of the Restrictions object.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The attribute _markedBy_ should be used to describe aids to navigation
used to demarcate the location, for example, by marking a limit line,
or one of the boundaries of an area.

Dock areas in S-101 ENCs that are not navigable at the maximum display
scale of the ENC data, are encoded in S-101 ENCs using the S-101 feature
Dock Area. Except for Gate, the boundaries of the dock are not encoded
as separate features.

Dock areas in S-101 ENCs that are navigable may be encoded as the
S-101 features Depth Area, Dredged Area or Unsurveyed Area (see the
S-101 DCEG), with the geo features making up the dock limits encoded
using appropriate features such as Coastline, Shoreline Construction
or Gate.

S-131 datasets may encode both types of S-101 ENC dock features according
to their primary use as a dock areas, using the S-131 feature type
*DockArea*. The _depthsDescription_ attribute must be used for textual
descriptions of the depths in the area.

If an encoded Dock Area has a date dependency, this should be indicated
using the complex attributes _fixedDateRange_ or _periodicDateRange_.

* The complex attribute horizontal clearance fixed is used to encode
the size of the entrance to the dock area, where required. This attribute
is not included in S-131 Edition 1.0, but should be in the underlying
ENC. If not, it may be encoded as text information in a _textContent_
attribute.

* The attributes horizontal clearance length and horizontal clearance
width are used to encode the regulatory length and width of the navigable
part of the dock area as declared by a competent authority, where
known. This attribute is not included in S-131 Edition 1.0, but should
be in the underlying ENC. If not, it may be encoded as text information
in a _textContent_ attribute

* S-101 guidance is that "[in] a non-tidal basin (wet dock), depths
may refer to a sounding datum different from that in open waters.
If this area is navigable at the maximum display scale of the ENC
data, the value of this datum must be encoded using the meta feature
Sounding Datum, with attribute vertical datum = 24 (local datum),
co- incident with the area covered by the dock." For S-131, depths
must be converted to the single sounding datum meta-feature and a
note regarding the conversion must be included in the _depthsDescription_
complex attribute.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The attribute _markedBy_ should be used to describe aids to navigation
used to demarcate the location, for example, by marking a limit line,
or one of the boundaries of an area.

[[sec_6.8.1]]
==== General

The *HarbourAreaAdministrative* feature is used for encoding the location
and extent of individual ports or harbours.

A *HarbourAreaAdministrative* feature may be subdivided into *HarbourAreaSection*
features to represent subdivisions of the harbour or port area
(see <<sec_6.9.1>>), but should be so subdivided only if the source
material includes such subdivisions, or if it is necessary to distinguish
portions of the harbour or port area (for example, if different sections
have different names or designations for administrative jurisdiction
purposes).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Services for import and export cargoes should be described in separate
instances of _cargoServicesDescription.textContent_. When this is
done, the _headline_ sub-attribute ot _textContent_ should indicate
whether the _textContent_ instance pertains to import or export cargoes.

* In the complex attribute _constructionInformation_, the _textContent_
sub-atttribute is used for encoding a textual and/or graphical description
of the development. The mandatory _development_ sub-attribute is used
for encoding a brief description of the type of development.

* In the complex attribute _weatherResource_, at least one of _onlineResource_
or _textContent_ must be populated. If _onlineResource_ is populated
_dynamicResource_ must be populated. If the information is to be obtained
from an external source, the external source must be indicated in
_onlineResource_,

* Links to online resources for weather information should be provided
in complex attribute _weatherResource_ and not in a linked *ContactDetails*
information type.

* Note also that _weatherResource_ binds the generic textual attribute
_textContent_ and therefore information about accessing the online
weather resource which cannot be encoded in other sub-attributes of
_weatherResource_ should be provided in that _textContent_ attribute
instead of creating a separate *ContactDetails* object.

* The attributes _categoryOfHarbourFacility_ and _generalHarbourInformation_
should be populated so that together the provide a complete overview
of port/harbour type and function. For example, if a large commercial
harbour area includes a marina in its jurisdiction, _categoryOfHarbourFacility_
should include the listed value 5 (Yacht Harbour/Marina). However,
it is not necessary to mention every single port service or facility
in these attributes.

* There is no requirement for a dataset to contain only one *HarbourAreaAdministrative* feature, even if the dataset covers only one port.

==== General

*HarbourAreaSection* features must be used when it is necessary to
represent subdivisions of a port or harbour area, or group harbour
facilities under a common designation. A *HarbourAreaSection* feature
may contain specialized features such as **Terminal**s, **Berth**s,
etc., and/or smaller *HarbourAreaSection* features.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If a *HarbourAreaSection* feature contains other *HarbourAreaSection*
features (i.e., is associated to other *HarbourAreaSection* features
via _subUnit_ roles), the _categoryOfPortSection_ and _categoryOfHarbourFacility_
attributes on the containing feature must be either (a) the union
or superset of the values of those attributes on its subdivisions,
or (b) not encoded in the containing feature.

* A *HarbourAreaSection* feature may have both _subUnit_ and _layoutUnit_
roles, i.e., it may contain other *HarbourAreaSection* feature as
well as specialized features such as *Terminal*, *Berth*, etc. Generally,
a *HarbourAreaSection* will have both types of roles only when it
contains subdivision **HarbourAreaSection**s that do not cover the
whole spatial extent of the container.

* If there is a subdivision hierarchy of *HarbourAreaSection* features,
specialized features (*Terminal*, *Berth*, etc.) or infrastructure
features should be associated to the *HarbourAreaSection* feature
at the lowest level possible (i.e., the lowest level that contains
the entire specialized or infrastructure feature).

* There is no requirement for *HarbourAreaSection* features to cover
the entire extent of a *HarbourAreaAdministrative* feature. For example,
larger ports may have areas which are spatially within the harbour
area (or adjacent to its navigable waters as legally defined) but
which are not controlled by the port authority, for example naval
bases or civic waterfronts.

[[sec_6.13.1]]
==== General

For a pilot boarding place, the pilot vessel may either cruise in
the area or come out on request. Off some large ports pilots on outgoing
ships may be disembarked at a different location. Pilots may board
from a helicopter; it is then less important for a ship to reach the
exact position of the boarding place but an approximate position should
still be encoded. Some pilot stations are used solely for long-distance
(deep-sea) pilots. Pilots may be in constant attendance, in regular
attendance at certain limited times, or available by previous arrangement
only. The primary purpose of encoded pilotage information is to show
the position of the facility. Because of the many variations in the
service provided, the main source of information on pilotage must
be in an associated publication or product.

If it is required to encode a pilot boarding place, it must be done
using the feature *Pilot Boarding Place*.

For general information about the representation of pilot boarding
places on charts, see S-4 -- B-491 and S-101 DCEG

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to encode the ship to shore or shore to ship contact
information, it must be done using the information class
*Contact Details* (see <<sec_11.4>>). The *Contact Details* must be
associated to the *Pilot Boarding Place* feature using the association
_AdditionalInformation_.

* The attribute _markedBy_ should be used to describe aids to navigation
used to demarcate the location, for example, by marking a limit line,
or one of the boundaries of an area.

==== General

Waterways can be encoded to indicate how specific sections of water
have been divided for various administrative purposes such as for
organizing traffic and managing the available water column. When it
is required to encode a section of water as one of the types mentioned
in the _categoryOfPortSection_ attribute, this must be done using
the feature *WaterwayArea* with _categoryOfPortSection_ set to the
appropriate value.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The attribute _markedBy_ should be used to describe aids to navigation
used to demarcate the location, for example, by marking a limit line,
or one of the boundaries of an area.

[underline]#Distinction:# DumpingGround; HarbourBasin; PilotBoardingPlace;
SeaplaneLandingArea; TurningBasin.
