== Services, Organisations, and Work Schedules

[[sec_11.1]]
=== Introduction

Information about the services available in specific areas is modelled
by means of an information association from the feature to the
*AvailablePortServices* information type. This relationship is depicted
<<fig_11.1>>. This type contains attributes for encoding various types
of services, in the form of enumeration attributes, details of which
are provided in <<sec_11.8>>.

[[sec_11.1.1]]
==== Work schedules and holidays

Operating schedules and business hours of organizations are encoded
by associating a *ServiceHours* instance to an *Authority*. Partial
work schedules on holidays or other special days are encoded by associating
a *NonstandardWorkingDay* instance to the *ServiceHours* instance.

Similarly, operating schedules for a facility are encoded by associating
a *ServiceHours* to the geo feature representing the facility, and
associating a *NonstandardWorkingDay* to the *ServiceHours* to encode
partial working days.

For further guidance and examples, see <<sec_2.4.10.4>>.

[[sec_11.1.2]]
==== Contact information

Contact information for service operators, controllers or facilities
should be encoded in instances of the *ContactDetails* information
type, which may be linked from multiple instances of geographic features
or information types. Any S-131 geographic feature except meta and
cartographic features can be associated to an instance of *ContactDetails*.
S-131 geographic feature inherit the association to ContactDetails
from the abstract feature type *OrganizationContactArea*, as shown
in <<fig_11.2>>.

Contact information must not be encoded directly in the feature or
information type instance using a _textContent_ or _information_ complex
attribute bound directly to the feature or information type. An instance
of *ContactDetails* must be created instead. The exception to this
rule is when contact-related attributes such as _communicationChannel_
are bound to the feature or information type, in which case a *ContactDetails*
instance should be created only if it is necessary to provide contact
information which cannot be coded in the contact-specific attributes
bound to the feature.

=== General

The Authority information type is used for encoding information about
organizations, including official authorities (port and other) as
well as private organizations which control or operate port facilities.

For encoding the contact details for an organization, use an associated
*ContactDetails* information type (see the information associations
table below).

For encoding the general operating hours of an organization, use an
associated *ServiceHours* information type (see clause 4.2.1.7 in
the main Product Specification).

For encoding the supervisory or operating organization for a facility
or area, such as a Terminal, use an information association from the
geo feature to Authority (see <<sec_5.4>> Supervised Area and
clause 4.2.1.7 in the main Product Specification).

=== General

The *ContactDetails* information type provides several attributes
for encoding different types of contact details.

*ContactDetails* may be associated to:

* An Authority information type via an information association
(_AuthorityContact_), in which case it encodes the contact information
for the organization in general.
* A geo feature via a feature association _ServiceContact_, inherited
by geo features from *OrganizationContactArea* (<<sec_5.3>>), in which
case it encodes contact information particular to the specific feature,
either because further information about the controlling authority
is not available or because the contact is specific to the feature.
[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to encode call name in different languages, this
must be done by associating an instance of *ContactDetails* per language,
with the originating instance. The *Language* attribute must be used
to designate the language of the instance.

* The name of the contact (for example, the name of the agency, pilot
service, office, etc.) should be encoded in the _featureName_ attribute,
which is inherited from *InformationType*.

* Non-standard workdays which cannot be represented using fixed or

preferably as a short description in the *text* sub-attribute of *information*.
The information attribute can also be used for encoding any additional
explanatory information if the explanation is essential knowledge
for specifying the day.

* The two date range attributes (fixed and periodic date range) should
be used if the non-standard day applies only in specific years or
periods (e.g., seasonally).
