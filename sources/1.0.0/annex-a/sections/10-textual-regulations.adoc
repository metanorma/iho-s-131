== Textual Regulations and Notes

[[sec_10.1]]
=== Introduction

The information types *Regulations*, *Restrictions*, *Recommendations*,
and *NauticalInformation* all inherit the attributes of their immediate
abstract superclass *AbstractRxN*, which provides attributes _textContent_
and _graphic_ for textual and pictorial material respectively.
The sub-attributes of its complex attribute _rxnCode_ allow optional
classification of the material encoded in _textContent/graphic_ according
to the type of material and the kind of nautical activity affected
by it. The classifications in _rxNCode_ sub-attributes _categoryOfRxN_
and _actionOrActivity_ are intended to facilitate software queries
for information, while the sub-attribute headline provides additional
topic headings for subject matter.

These four information types also inherit the attributes of abstract
superclass *InformationType*, which allows encoding of the effective
and expiry dates, if any, and the source of information
footnote:[Source information is currently broken out into three attributes:
source, sourceType, and reportedDate, due to GI Registry issues with
the complex attribute sourceIndication.], if it is necessary to encode
that data.

The content of the regulation (recommendation, etc.) should be encoded
in the _textContent_ attribute, which is also inherited from the abstract
superclass *InformationType*. It may be encoded inline
(_textContent.information.text_) or in an external file
(_textContent.information.fileReference_) depending on its length,
on whether it is unique to the feature instance, and on whether the
producer decides to include a support file containing multiple sections
referenced from different places in the dataset. (See also <<sec_2.4.8;and!sec_2.4.9>>
for general guidance on encoding textual information.)

These four information types are intended primarily for encoding textual
information, such as that which derives from textual source material
such as port handbooks, national or local laws or official publications.

Where possible, these types should be classified using the _categoryOfRxN_
and _actionOrActivity_ codelists in the _rxnCode_ complex attribute.
Being open enumeration codelists, they allow for additional categories
not listed among their standard values. For example, an "under repair"
activity might be encoded in the _actionOrActivity_ attribute
(as "other: underRepair", following the syntax rule for encoding "extra"
values in open enumerations footnote:[S-100 3-6.7 specifies the format
as "The word 'other' followed by a colon and a single space character
(that is 'other: ' without quotes), followed by one or more alphanumeric
strings separated by single spaces."]).

Producers should note that such extra values will merely be displayed
and not processed (for example, the user interface will not use extra
values to choose symbols or filter instances of *Regulations
footnote:[In the interest of brevity, "Regulations" in this sub-clause
stands for any one of the four types described by this section.]*,
whereas it may apply filters to the standard values and/or them in
portrayal).

The _headline_ attribute of _rxNCode_ should be used to encode brief
topic headings describing the textual content of the *Regulations*
object. Topic headings in the source material may be suitable either
as-is or being adapted for use in the intended application context
(for example, being shortened for readability on an ECDIS screen or
auxiliary display). The _headline_ attribute of the _textContent/information_
attribute may also be used to provide sub-heads but must not duplicate
the content of _rxNCode/headline_.

Where multiple headline attributes are encoded in the same instance
of _rxNCode_ complex attribute, they must be ordered as follows:

. If the _headline_ values are derived from a source material (such
as the published legal text of a government regulation), the ordering
must conform to the hierarchy in the source, for example, section
headings must precede sub-section headings. It is not necessary to
include the entire hierarchy of headings for the portion that is actually
encoded in the _textContent_ co-attribute.
. If the _headline_ values are not derived from a source text, the
ordering should be from general to specific.

==== Regulations, etc., for specific locations

All geo features may have an association to any of Regulations or
its sibling information types. This association is _AssociatedRxN_
and it is inherited from the root feature type *FeatureType*.

If it is necessary to identify an authority or organization related
to a particular regulation (restriction, etc.) object, this may be
done using the _RelatedOrganisation_ association between *Regulations*,
etc., and an *Authority* object.

==== Regulations applying only to vessels with specific characteristics or cargoes

Regulations applying only to vessels of specified types, exceeding
specified dimensions, or carrying specified cargoes (or other limitations
which apply only to subsets of vessels) are encoded by defining the
subset of vessels using an *Applicability* instance and associating
the *Regulations* object to that *Applicability*.

For information on the use of Applicability to define subsets of vessels,
see <<sec_12>> in this DCEG and clause 4.2.1.9 in the main PS.

==== General

*Regulations* is intended to be used for official rules, laws, and
similar source material, i.e., sources that have the force of law
or are mandated by a controlling authority. They will generally originate
from some kind of administration or authority, including port authorities.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Association _AssociatedRxN_ is with a geographic feature. While
an association from geographic feature to information type can be
encoded in the geographic feature instance, the reverse association
from the information type to the geographic feature may be omitted
from the information type instance.

==== General

*Restrictions* is intended for restrictions that constrain the activities
of vessels temporarily with or without the legal force, or for longer
terms without the force of law; they may be issued by a local authority
such as a port captain or US Coast Guard district.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Association _AssociatedRxN_ is with a geographic feature. While
an association from geographic feature to information type can be
encoded in the geographic feature instance, the reverse association
from the information type to the geographic feature may be omitted
from the information type instance.

[[sec_10.4.1]]
==== General

Recommendations is intended for encoding suggestions, limitations,
or preferred procedures that are not mandatory.

For example, a recommendation for approaching a particular berth at
a given orientation may be encoded in a *Recommendations* object associated
to the *Berth* feature with an _AssociatedRxN_ association from the
*Berth* to the *Recommendations* object. If it is a port rule rather
than a recommendation, it should be encoded as a *Restrictions* or
*Regulations* object instead, with the same association from the *Berth*
feature.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Association _AssociatedRxN_ is with a geographic feature. While
an association from geographic feature to information type can be
encoded in the geographic feature instance, the reverse association
from the information type to the geographic feature may be omitted
from the information type instance.

8+| [underline]#INT 1 Reference:# --*NauticalInformation* is intended
for material that is largely informative in nature, of which does
not fit into the category of regulation, recommendation, or restriction.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Association _AdditionalInformation_ may be with a geographic feature
or an information type. Association _AssociatedRxN_ is with a geographic
feature. While an association from geographic feature to information
type can be encoded in the geographic feature instance, the reverse
association from the information type to the geographic feature may
be omitted from the information type instance.
* In theory, *Nautical Information* can be associated with any geographic
feature through either an _AdditionalInformation_ or _AssociatedRxN_
association. _AdditionalInformation_ should be used only when the
information encoded in *Nautical Information* is general in nature
and does not supplement information encoded in a *Regulations*, *Restrictions*,
or *Recommendations* object associated to the same feature.
* According to a purely theoretical reading of the model,
*Nautical Information* can be associated to another *Nautical Information*,
*Regulations*, *Restrictions*, or *Recommendations* instance using
the _AdditionalInformation_ association inherited from
*Information Type*. This is not permitted due to the undefined semantics
of chaining RxN types (i.e., such chaining has little or no significant
meaning and has not been given any special meaning in the model).
