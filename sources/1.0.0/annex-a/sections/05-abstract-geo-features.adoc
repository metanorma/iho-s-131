== Abstract Geo Features

[[sec_5.1]]
=== Introduction

This clause describes abstract feature types. The abstract types cannot
be used directly, but define attributes and associations inherited
by their sub-types. The encoding remarks in the description of each
abstract feature apply to its sub-types but may be overridden by remarks
in the sub-type.

The abstract feature types are depicted in <<fig_5.1>>. At the root
is the type named *FeatureType*, from which all feature types except
cartographic and meta-features inherit several attributes. This means
that any Geo feature in S-131 can have any of the several attributes
in the *FeatureType* box. This type also has information associations
to three information types, and a feature association to *TextPlacement*
which, as for attributes, allows any S-131 Geo feature to have the
same associations. The feature types *OrganizationContactArea* and
*SupervisedArea* define no local attributes but inherit the attributes
of *FeatureType*, however each adds an additional information association
which is inherited by all Geo features in S-131.

The abstract feature hierarchy in S-131 is intentionally harmonised
with the abstract hierarchy in other nautical publications Product
Specifications, specifically S-127 (Marine Traffic Management), which
has a more complex structure than S-131 necessitating the use of the
abstract types *OrganizationContactArea* and *SupervisedArea* (in
S-131, unlike S-127, these classes do not have separate sub-hierarchies).
The abstract types *Layout* and *HarbourPhysicalInfrastructure* distinguish
S-131 features describing harbour layout from those describing infrastructure.

This top-level hierarchy of types in S-131 means than any S-131 Geo
feature can have any or all of the five information associations in
<<fig_5.1>>, and also an associated *TextPlacement* cartographic feature
to position text. Cartographic and meta-features are not derived from
this abstract hierarchy and do not inherit these attributes and associations.

[underline]#INT 1 Reference: pass-format:metanorma[--]#

[[sec_5.2.1]]
==== General

Where a complex attribute has all its sub-attributes optional (e.g.,
multiplicity 0..1 or 0..*), at least one of the sub-attributes must
be populated.

The _AdditionalInformation_ association to a *NauticalInfomation*
object can be used to attach an additional chunk of information to
a feature, and there is no applicable specific information type or
association. This should be used sparingly if at all.

The _PermissionType_ association is used to encode permission information
(e.g., whether use or entry is prohibited, etc) for vessels with different
characteristics, if such permissions or requirements exist for a feature.

The _AssociatedRxN_ association allows (mostly) textual information
pertaining to regulations, etc., to be associated to features.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The complex attribute _rxNCode_ when bound to a feature allows features
to be tagged with keywords that make it easier for software queries
to search for features relevant to particular subjects or to particular
kinds of vessel operations. See <<sec_9.1>> for guidance on encoding
values of _rxNCode_ sub-attributes.
* Regulations, recommendations, restrictions, or general nautical
information must be encoded in the appropriate associated information
type (see <<sec_9.3;and!sec_10>>). The ability to encode _rxNCode_
and _textContent_ as attributes of features must not be used to avoid
encoding instances of *Regulations*, *Restrictions*, *Recommendations*,
or *NauticalInformation,* because encoding the same type of information
using different methods or different structures in the same dataset
or data product makes it more difficult for the mariner to find information.
* When encoding text information in the complex attribute _textContent_,
it is not necessary to encode the entire content in a single instance
of the _information_ sub-attribute. Instead, the information should
be organized so that each instance of _information_ deals with a distinct
topic or sub-topic, each with an appropriate heading in the _headline_
attribute. This will make it easier for readers to find a topic. Part,
chapter, section and sub-section headings in the source material may
be used in either verbatim or condensed form, ordered according to
the hierarchy in the source.
* Multiple instances of _textContent_ should be used when the encoded
material bears different relationships to the source (abstract/extract
vs. summary vs. full text).
* Multiple instances of _textContent_ may be used to distinguish information
available purely as an external reference (in the _onlineResource_
sub-attribute) from information encoded within the dataset (in the
_information.text_ sub-attribute or in a support file).
* In general, encoders may use the multiplicities of _textContent_
and its sub-attributes to organize textual information so as to facilitate
structuring text by topic, avoid flooding end-user screens with large
blocks of unorganized text, and improve its accessibility to the mariner.

[[sec_5.3.1]]
==== General

If it is necessary to encode contact information related to a particular
feature, without encoding information about a supervising or controlling
authority, it should be done using an associated *ContactDetails*
information type. This can be used when

* information about the supervising authority is unavailable, or,
* when the contact information pertains to a particular feature, but
not to all features supervised by the authority. For example, if contact
details for different terminals are different though they are operated
by the same operator, the _ServiceContact_ association can be used
to link particular contact information to particular terminal features.
[underline]#Remarks:#

* Adds the _ServiceContact_ association to *ContactDetails* for any
sub-feature class.

[[sec_5.4.1]]
==== General

If it is necessary to encode information a controlling authority or
organization for a particular location, it should be done using an
associated *Authority* information type. Contact details for the organization
should be encoded in a *ContactDetails* associated to the *Authority*.

For example, information about terminal operators may be encoded in
an *Authority* information type associated to the feature via a _ServiceControl_
association. The Harbourmaster's office should be encoded as an *Authority*
associated to the whole port area, represented by a *HarbourAreaAdministrative*
feature

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Adds the _ServiceControl_ association to *Authority* for any sub
feature class.

[[sec_5.5.1]]
==== General

This feature type is the immediate supertype for all physical infrastructure
features and defines a single optional attribute for the clearance
value.

The _Infrastructure_ association to the Terminal feature type is intended
for encoding the infrastructure (represented by the sub-types of
*HarbourPhysicalInfrastructure*) available in a *Terminal*. For example,
if it is necessary to indicate that a particular terminal has dry
dock facilities, it should be done by encoding a *DryDock* feature
and associating it to the *Terminal* feature by the _Infrastructure_
association.
