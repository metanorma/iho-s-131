==== General

++[Reserved for development in a future edition.]++

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Aids to navigation should not be encoded in the attribute _landmarkDescription_.
Instead, they should be encoded in the appropriate attribute for describing
marks (_offshoreMarkDescription_, _majorLightsDescription_, or _usefulMarksDescription_).
* The attribute _markedBy_ should be used to describe aids to navigation
used to demarcate the location, for example, by marking a limit line,
or one of the boundaries of an area.

[underline]#Distinction:#
