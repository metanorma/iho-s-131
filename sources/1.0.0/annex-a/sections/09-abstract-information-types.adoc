== Abstract Information types

[[sec_9.1]]
=== Introduction

The abstract feature types are depicted in <<fig_9.1>>. At the root
is the type named *InformationType*, from which all information types
except *SpatialQuality* inherit several attributes. This means that
any information type in S-131 except *SpatialQuality* can have any
of the several attributes in the *InformationType* box. The information
types *AbstractRxN* adds attributes and associations inherited by
the four types *Regulations*, *Restrictions*, *Recommendations*, and
*NauticalInformation*.

The abstract information type hierarchy in S-131 is intentionally
harmonised with the abstract hierarchy in other nautical publications
Product Specifications.

==== General

Where a complex attribute has all its sub-attributes optional (e.g.,
multiplicity 0..1 or 0..*), at least one of the sub-attributes must
be populated.

The *featureName* attribute of an instance of an information type
can be used for a short title that is either a proper name (if such
is relevant) or which describes the instance. For example, the *featureName*
attribute of an *Authority* information type can be the name of a
government agency.

*featureName* attributes of information types should not duplicate
the geographic feature name of an associated feature, but should pertain
to the information instance itself. The *featureName* attribute should
be populated only if the value conveys useful information to the end
user. Some examples of such situations are:

* providing the name of an organisation, such as the name of an Authority.

* distinguishing between instances -- if multiple instances of the
same information type are associated to the same feature type (or
another information type), the different instances may be given descriptive
names to make it easier for the mariner to distinguish their content.

Some information instances are associated to multiple features, in
which case its name should be general enough to be relevant to all
the features.

For example, if naming *Regulations* instances describing regulations,
consider whether (for example) there is a general regulation applicable
to all areas in a jurisdiction and an exceptional regulations object
associated to a single area or a subset of areas in the jurisdiction.
In this situation, the general regulations may be encoded with the
name "General regulations for (feature type) Areas" and associated
to several features, while a specific feature can also have a specific
regulation whose name is "Special regulations for (named area)".

The *AdditionalInformation* association to a *NauticalInfomation*
object can be used to attach an additional chunk of information to
an information type, when there is no applicable specific information
type or association. This should be used sparingly if at all.

[[sec_9.3.1]]
==== Abstract supertype for information from textual sources

*AbstractRxN* is the supertype of the four types intended primarily
for encoding information from regulatory or other text sources. The
attributes *categoryOfRxN* and *actionOrActivity* should be encoded
wherever possible in order to allow software to classify the content
according to the type of regulation (*categoryOfRxN*) and its effects
on common maritime activities by both commercial and recreational
vessels.

At least one of the attributes *textContent* and *graphic* must be
populated.

Subtypes of *AbstractRxN* must not be associated to *Nautical Information*,
since this leads to chains of information types which have little
or no meaning in reality.

[underline]#Remarks:#

The complex attribute _rxNCode_ can be used to classify regulations
(or recommendations, etc.) according to their principal subject (sub-attribute
_categoryOfRxN_) and the type of vessel activity affected (sub-attribute
_actionOrActivity_), as well as provide a sequence of brief topic
headings (sub-attribute headline). The _rxNCode_ attribute is intended
to be used to allow mariners to obtain information relevant to particular
subjects or to particular kinds of vessel operations.
