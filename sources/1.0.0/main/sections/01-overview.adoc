== Overview

[[sec_1.1]]
=== Introduction

S-131 is the Marine Harbour Infrastructure (MHI) Product Specification,
produced by the International Hydrographic Organization. S-131 is
designed to allow content, content definition (Feature Catalogues)
and presentation (Portrayal Catalogues) to be updateable without breaking
system implementations.

This document has been produced by the IHO Nautical Information Provision
Working Group (NIPWG) in response to a requirement to produce a data
product that can be used as a Nautical Publication Information Overlay
(NPIO) within an Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems
(ECDIS). It is based on the IHO S-100 framework specification and
the ISO 19100 series of standards. It is a vector product specification
that is intended for encoding information relating to port and harbour
facilities for facilitating berth-to-berth navigation.

Marine Harbour Infrastructure (MHI) datasets describe the layout of
ports and the availability of port services. This includes facility
locations, service areas, services offered, and instructions for contacting
or utilizing these services. MHI is intended to be a supplement to
ENC, and therefore does not describe the geographic information in
detail equal to ENC.

[[sec_1.2]]
=== Scope

This document describes an S-100 compliant Product Specification for
Marine Harbour Infrastructure, which will form an overlay layer for
an S-100 based marine navigation system. It specifies the content,
structure, and metadata needed for creating a fully compliant S-131
product and for its portrayal within an S-100 system. This Product
Specification includes the content model, the encoding, the Feature
Catalogue, Portrayal Catalogue, and metadata.

[[sec_1.4.2]]
[heading="terms and definitions"]
==== Terms and definitions

===== accuracy

Closeness of agreement between a test result and the accepted reference
values.

NOTE: A test result can be from an observation or measurement.

===== aggregation

Special form of {{association}} that specifies a whole-part relationship
between the aggregate (whole) and a component part.

===== alarm

(MSC.302/A) a high-priority {{alert}}. Condition requiring immediate
attention and action by the bridge team, to maintain the safe navigation
of the ship.

===== alert

(MSC.302/A) announcement of abnormal situations and conditions requiring
attention. Alerts are divided in four priorities: **emergency alarm**s,
{{alarm,alarms}}, {{warning,warnings}} and {{caution,cautions}}.
An alert provides information about a defined state change in connection
with information about how to announce this event in a defined way
to the system and the operator.

===== application schema

Conceptual schema for data required by one or more applications.

===== association

Semantic relationship between two or more classifiers that specifies
connections among their instances.

===== attribute

(1) Named property of an entity.

NOTE: Describes a geometrical, topological, thematic, or other characteristic
of an entity.

(2) Feature within a classifier that describes a range of values that
instances of the classifier may hold.

NOTE: An attribute is semantically equivalent to a composition association;
however, the intent and usage is normally different.

NOTE: "Feature" used in this definition is the UML meaning of the
term.

===== boundary

Set that represents the limit of an entity.

NOTE: Boundary is most commonly used in the context of geometry, where
the set is a collection of points or a collection of objects that
represent those points.

===== caution

(MSC.302/A) lowest priority of an {{alert}}. Awareness of a condition
which does not warrant an {{alarm}} or warning condition, but still
requires attention out of the ordinary consideration of the situation
or of given information.

===== class

Description of a set of objects that share the same {{attribute,attributes}},
operations, methods, {{relationship,relationships}}, and semantics.

NOTE: A class represents a concept within the system being modelled.
Depending on the kind of model, the concept may be real-world (for
an analysis model), or it may also contain algorithmic and computer
implementation concepts (for a design model). A classifier is a generalization
of class that includes other class-like elements, such as data type,
actor and component.

===== classification

The process of determining the appropriate {{data type}} within a
{{feature catalogue}} for a particular real world feature, including
consideration of {{data quality}}.

===== coordinate

One of a sequence of n numbers designating the position of a {{point}}
in n-dimensional space.

NOTE: In a {{coordinate reference system}}, the coordinate numbers
are qualified by units.

===== coordinate reference system

{{coordinate,Coordinate}} system that is related to an object by a
datum.

NOTE: For geodetic and vertical datums, the object will be the Earth.

===== coordinate tuple

Ordered list of {{coordinate,coordinates}}.

===== curve

1-dimensional {{geometric primitive}}, representing the continuous
image of a line.

NOTE: The boundary of a curve is the set of points at either end of
the curve. If the curve is a cycle, the two ends are identical, and
the curve (if topologically closed) is considered to not have a boundary.
The first point is called the start point, and the last is the end
point. Connectivity of the curve is guaranteed by the
"continuous image of a line" clause. A topological theorem states
that a continuous image of a connected set is connected.

===== curve segment

1-dimensional geometric object used to represent a continuous component
of a {{curve}} using homogeneous interpolation and definition methods.

NOTE: The geometric set represented by a single curve segment is equivalent
to a curve.

===== data product

A {{dataset}} or dataset series that conforms to a data product specification.

===== data quality

A set of elements describing aspects of quality, including a measure
of quality, an evaluation procedure, a quality result, and a scope.

===== data type

Specification of a value domain with operations allowed on values
in this domain.

NOTE: Data types include primitive predefined types and user-definable
types.

NOTE: A data type is identified by a term, for example Integer.

[example]
Integer, Real, Boolean, String, DirectPosition and Date

===== dataset

An identifiable collection of data.

NOTE: A dataset may be a smaller grouping of data which, though limited
by some constraint such as spatial extent or feature type,is located
physically within a larger dataset. Theoretically, a dataset may be
as small as a single feature contained within a larger dataset.
A hardcopy map or chart may be considered a dataset.

===== datum

Parameter or set of parameters that define the position of the origin,
the scale, and the orientation of a {{coordinate}} system.

===== display priority

Hierarchy to determine which {{feature}} is to be displayed when two
features overlap. Priority 2 overwrites 1.

===== ecdis

A navigation information system which with adequate back-up arrangements
can be accepted as complying with the up-to-date chart required by
regulations V/19 and V/27 of the 1974 SOLAS Convention, as amended,
by displaying selected information from a System Electronic Navigational
Chart (SENC) with positional information from navigation sensors to
assist the Mariner in route planning and route monitoring, and if
required display additional navigation-related information.

===== enc

The {{dataset}}, standardized as to content, structure and format,
issued for use with {{ECDIS}} by or on the authority of a Government
authorized Hydrographic Office or other relevant government institution,
and conforming to IHO standards. The ENC contains all the chart information
necessary for safe navigation and may contain supplementary information
in addition to that contained in the paper chart which may be considered
necessary for safe navigation.

===== enumeration

A fixed list of valid identifiers of named literal values.
{{attribute,Attributes}} of an enumerated type may only take values
from this list.

===== feature

Abstraction of real world phenomena.

NOTE: A feature may occur as a type or an instance. Feature type or
feature instance should be used when only one is meant.

[example]
The phenomenon named 'London Eye' may be classified as a feature instance
with other phenomena into a feature type 'landmark'

===== feature association

{{relationship,Relationship}} that links instances of one {{feature}}
type with instances of the same or a different {{feature}} type.

===== feature attribute

Characteristic of a {{feature}}.

NOTE: A feature {{attribute}} may occur as a type or an instance.
Feature attribute type or feature attribute instance is used when
only one is meant.

NOTE: A feature {{attribute}} type has a name, a {{data type}} and
a domain associated to it. A feature {{attribute}} instance has an
attribute value taken from the value domain of the feature {{attribute}}
type.

NOTE: In a {{feature catalogue}}, a feature {{attribute}} may include
a value domain but does not specify {{attribute}} values for feature
instances.

[example]
A feature attribute named _communication channel_ may have an attribute
value _VHF0007_ which belongs to the data type _text_

[example]
A feature attribute named _length_ may have an attribute value _82.4_
which belongs to the data type _real_

===== feature catalogue

A catalogue containing definitions and descriptions of the {{feature}}
types, {{feature attribute,feature attributes}}, and {{feature association,feature associations}} occurring in one or more sets of geographic data.

===== geometric primitive

Geometric object representing a single, connected, homogeneous element
of geometry.

NOTE: Geometric primitives are non-decomposed objects that present
information about geometric configuration. They include points, curves,
surfaces, and solids.

===== human readable

A representation of information that can be naturally read by humans.

===== identifier

A linguistically independent sequence of characters capable of uniquely
and permanently identifying that with which it is associated.

===== indication

Visual indication giving information about the condition of a system
or equipment.

===== instance

Entity to which a set of operations can be applied and which has a
state that stores the effects of the operations.

NOTE: See {{feature}}.

===== loxodrome

A loxodrome is a line crossing all meridians at the same angle, that
is, a path of constant bearing.

===== machine readable

A representation of information that can be processed by computers.

===== maximum display scale

The larger value of the ratio of the linear dimensions of features
of a dataset presented in the display and the actual dimensions of
the features represented (largest scale) of the scale range of the
dataset.

===== metadata

Data about data.

===== minimum display scale

The smaller value of the ratio of the linear dimensions of features
of a dataset presented in the display and the actual dimensions of
the features represented (smallest scale) of the scale range of the
dataset.

===== model

Abstraction of some aspects of universe of discourse.

NOTE: A semantically complete abstraction of a system.

===== multiplicity

Specification of the number of possible occurrences of a property,
or the number of allowable elements that may participate in a given
relationship.

[example]
1..++*++ (one to many); 1 (exactly one); 0..1 (zero or one)

===== overscale

The viewing scale is larger than the value considered by the data
producer to be the largest intended (maximum) display scale for the
data.

===== point

0-dimensional {{geometric primitive}}, representing a position.

NOTE: The {{boundary}} of a point is the empty set.

===== portrayal catalogue

Collection of defined portrayals for a {{feature catalogue}}.

NOTE: Kinds of relationships include association, generalization,
metarelationship, flow, and several kinds grouped under dependency.

===== scale minimum

The smallest scale at which a feature is displayed (for example, a
minor light, with a scale minimum of 1:45,000, would not be displayed
at a scale of 1:90,000).

===== surface

Connected 2-dimensional {{geometric primitive}}, representing the
continuous image of a region of a plane.

NOTE: The boundary of a surface is the set of oriented, closed {{curve,curves}}
that delineate the limits of the surface.

===== symbol size

The size is specified in normalized units of 0.01 mm. The minimum
dimension is always more than 4 mm. This size applies to display on
a standard minimum screen.

===== text label

A textual description of a {{feature}}. Can be formatted to include
standard text as well as {{feature attribute}} values. For example,
light descriptions, place names etc.

===== transparent fill

A method of identifying features of *geometric primitive surface*
by covering a given percentage of each 4 pixel square with the fill
colour, leaving the remainder "transparent". Used to ensure the information
underneath shows through.

===== vertical datum

Datum describing the relation of gravity-related heights or depths
to the Earth.

===== warning

(MSC.302/A) {{alert}} for condition requiring immediate attention,
but no immediate action by the bridge team. Warnings are presented

[[sec_1.7]]
=== IHO Product Specification maintenance

[[sec_1.7.1]]
==== Introduction

Changes to S-131 will be released by the IHO as a New Edition, revision,
or clarification.

[[sec_1.7.2]]
==== New Edition

_New Editions_ of S-131 introduce significant changes. _New Editions_
enable new concepts, such as the ability to support new functions
or applications, or the introduction of new constructs or data types.
_New Editions_ are likely to have a significant impact on either existing
users or future users of S-131. All cumulative _revisions_ and _clarifications_
must be included with the release of approved New Editions.

[[sec_1.7.3]]
==== Revision

_Revisions_ are defined as substantive semantic changes to S-131.
Typically, _revisions_ will change S-131 to correct factual errors;
or introduce necessary changes that have become evident as a result
of practical experience or changing circumstances. A _revision_ must
not be classified as a clarification. _Revisions_ could have an impact
on either existing users or future users of S-131. All cumulative
_clarifications_ must be included with the release of approved corrections
revisions.

Changes in a _revision_ are minor and ensure backward compatibility
with the previous versions within the same Edition. Newer revisions,
for example, introduce new features and attributes. Within the same
Edition, a dataset of one version could always be processed with a
later version of the Feature and Portrayal Catalogues.

In most cases a new Feature Catalogue will result in a _revision_
of S-131.

[[sec_1.7.4]]
==== Clarification

_Clarifications_ are defined as non-substantive changes. Typically,
_clarifications_: remove ambiguity; correct grammatical and spelling
errors; amend or update cross references; and insert improved graphics.
A _clarification_ must not cause any substantive semantic change to
a data product.

Changes in a _clarification_ are minor and ensure backward compatibility
with the previous versions.

[[sec_1.7.5]]
==== Version numbers

The associated version control numbering to identify changes (n) to
this Product Specification must be as follows:

New Editions denoted as *n*.0.0

Revisions denoted as n.*n*.0

Clarifications denoted as n.n.*n*
