== Metadata

[[sec_14.1]]
=== Introduction

For information exchange, there are several categories of metadata
required:

* metadata about the overall exchange set and catalogue;
* discovery metadata about each of the datasets contained in the catalogue;
and
* discovery metadata about the support files that make up the package.

The discovery metadata classes have numerous attributes which enable
important information about the datasets and accompanying support
files to be examined without the need to process the data, for example,
decrypt, decompress, load, etc.

Discovery metadata for each dataset is given in an XML block within
the exchange set catalogue file, and can be accessed without opening
the GML dataset file. Discovery metadata is described in <<sec_14.2>>.

Since S-131 does not add product-specific metadata attributes, the
S-100 metadata classes and schema are used in S-131 exchange sets
without extension. The constraints S-131 imposes on generic S-100
metadata are included in <<sec_14.2>>, generally as remarks describing
the extra conditions and restrictions imposed by S-131 (such as making
an optional attribute mandatory).

The S-131 product specification package includes an implementation
of the S-131 constraints on metadata attributes) as Schematron rules
in files available from the IHO schema server. The generic S-100 schemas
distribution includes a similar implementation of "sanity checks"
and S-100 constraints However, neither S-100 not S-131 mandate use
of Schematron processors or the distributed Schematron rule files
in implementations. Implementers may substitute any implementation
method to apply or check constraints instead of using a Schematron-capable
processor, including re-encoding the constraints in any suitable
implementation-specific language.

This clause defines the mandatory and optional metadata needed for
S-131. In some cases (if provided by the producer or exchange set
packager) the metadata may be repeated in a language other than English.
See S-100 Part 17 Clauses 17-4.6 - 17-4.8 for guidance on encoding
of metadata in languages other than English.

=== Discovery metadata

An outline of the overall concept of an S-131 exchange set for the
interchange of geospatial data and its relevant metadata is explained
in <<sec_13>>. The place of metadata in the exchange set is summarised
in <<sec_13.1>>.

<<fig_14.1>> depicts the structure of the exchange catalogue and its
component discovery metadata blocks.

[[fig_14.1]]
.Relationship between exchange catalogue, discovery metadata, and dataset (from S-100 5.0.0 Figure 17-6).
image::figure-27.png[]

The detailed structure of the S-131 exchange catalogue is depicted
in <<fig_14.2>>. This figure is derived from Figure 17-7 in S-100
Edition 5.0.0, with the following restriction:

* Elements that are optional in the generic S-100 catalogue model
but not used in S-131 are not shown; for example, the ISO 8211 and
HDF5 formats in *S100_EncodingFormat*.

[[fig_14.2]]

image::figure-28.png[]

The following clauses define the mandatory and optional metadata needed
for S-131. In some cases the metadata may be repeated in a national
language. If this is the case it is noted in the Remarks column.

In the following clauses, wherever S-131 makes an optional S-100 metadata
attribute mandatory (that is, restricts multiplicity from 0.. to 1..),
the restricted multiplicity is shown in place of the multiplicity
given in S-100 Part 17. When this is done, the Remarks column contains
a note about the restriction. Further, enumerations in the figure
and the following clauses show only the values allowed in S-131 Exchange
Catalogues. These differences from the S-100 generic metadata are
in red bold font.

==== S100_ExchangeCatalogue

The Catalogue file is defined in XML Schema language. The Exchange
Catalogue inherits the dataset discovery metadata and support file
discovery metadata from S-100 with additional S-131-specific restrictions.

codelist. The conditions for the use of a particular value are described
in its Remarks
| Value | asNeeded | Resource is updated as deemed necessary | 1
| Use only for datasets which normally use a regular interval for
update or supersession, but will have the next update issued at an
interval different from the usualAllowed if and only if
userDefinedMaintenanceFrequency is not populated

==== Types for digital signatures

The types relating to digital signatures:

* S100_SE_CertificateContainer
* S100_SE_DigitalSignatureReference
* S100_SE_DigitalSignatureValue
* S100_SE_SignatureOnData
* S100_SE_SignatureOnSignature
* DataStatus

=== Language

The exchange language must be English. Other languages may be used
as a supplementary option. National geographic names can be left in
their original national language using the complex attribute
*feature name*.

Character strings must be encoded using the character set defined
in <<ISO 10646-1>>, in Unicode Transformation Format-8 (UTF-8).
A BOM (byte order mark) must not be used.
