== Maintenance

[[sec_10.1]]
=== Introduction

This clause describes the requirement to adequately maintain datasets;
use of newly acquired source data; maintenance requirements within
the overall production process; and how Feature and Portrayal Catalogues
are to be managed within an S-100 based marine navigation system.

[[sec_10.2]]
=== Maintenance and update frequency

Datasets must be maintained as needed; and the overall production
process must include mechanisms for updating designed to meet the
needs of the mariner regarding safety of navigation.

[[sec_10.3]]
=== Data Source

Data Producers must use all available and applicable sources, as evaluated
against a robust data assessment process, to maintain and update datasets
as required.

[[sec_10.4]]
=== Production Process

Data Producers should follow their established production processes
for maintaining and updating datasets. Data must be maintained against
S-131 Annex A -- _Data Classification and Encoding Guide_, checked
against S-131 Annex D -- _Validation Checks_, and encapsulated in
GML conforming to the S-131 GML schema.

[[sec_10.5]]
=== Feature and Portrayal Catalogue management

For each new version of the S-131 Product Specification a new Feature
and Portrayal Catalogue will be released. The end user system must
be able to manage datasets and their corresponding Catalogues that
are created using different versions of the S-131 Product Specification.
