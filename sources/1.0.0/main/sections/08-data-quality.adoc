== Data Quality

[[sec_8.1]]
=== Introduction

Data quality allows users and user systems to assess fitness for use
of the provided data. Data quality measures and the associated evaluation
are reported as metadata of a data product. This metadata improves
interoperability with other data products and provides scope for usage
by user groups that the data product was not originally intended for.
The secondary users can make assessments of the data product usefulness
in their application based on the reported data quality measures.

For S-131 the following data quality elements have been included:

* Conformance to this Product Specification;
* Intended purpose of the data product;
* Completeness of the data product in terms of coverage;
* Logical consistency;
* Depth uncertainty and accuracy;
* Positional uncertainty and accuracy;
* Thematic accuracy;
* Temporal quality;
* Aggregation measures;
* Validation checks or conformance checks including:

* General tests for dataset integrity; and
* Specific tests for compliance against the S-131 data model.

=== Quality measure elements

The data quality measures recommended in S-97 (Part C) and their applicability
in S-131 are indicated in <<table_8.1>> below. NA indicates the measure
is not applicable. This table reproduces the first 4 columns of the
data quality checklist recommended elements and replaces the final
column with descriptions of the scope of the element in the context
of S-131 datasets.

This is a RATE which is a ratio, and is expressed as a REAL number representing the rational fraction corresponding to the numerator and denominator of the ratio.

For example, if there are 1 items that are classified incorrectly
and there are 100 of the items in the dataset then the ratio is 1/100
and the reported rate = 0.01.

=== Test methods for data compliance and usability

Test methods for evaluating data compliance consist of executing the
relevant tests from the Validation Checks (Annex D) for each quality
element in <<table_8.1>> and counting the number of instances in the
dataset which fail the checks for that quality element.

Note that in some cases "executing the relevant test" may involve
comparing the encoded S-131 dataset to the source material by visual
means (e.g., for measures 17 and 18). For tests requiring visual comparison
of encoded data to source material, sampling methods may be used if
the volume of data precludes checking all the relevant data objects.

Accuracy computations for Positional Accuracy / Absolute or External
Accuracy should use the following recommendations:

Maximum RMSE (horizontal) = E / 10000

Where:

E = Denominator of intended scale of mapping

In addition to the above, dataset usability must be assessed against:

* Intended user requirements in regard to coverage, scale and specific
content requirements as defined by the Producing Agency and key stakeholders;

* Conformance to established maintenance processes (see Clause X.X); and

* Overall compliance with the S-131 Product Specification, including
context-specific evaluation of individual encoding instances for requirement
of conformance to checks classified as "Error" and "Warning" in
Annex D -- Validation Checks.

For dataset integrity requirements, see <<sec_13.8>>.

[[sec_8.4]]
=== Data quality testing and reporting

S-131 products must be tested with the S-131 specific checks prior
to release by the data producer. The data producer must review the
check results and address any issues to ensure sufficient quality
of the data products. The checks are a mix of data format validation
checks, conformance to standard checks and logical consistency checks.
The checks are listed in a separate Annex D.

Production and certification processes for S-131 data may include
a standalone quality report which provides full information on the
original results (with evaluation procedures and measures applied).
This report may be included in the exchange set as a support file
(discovery metadata for data quality reports should indicate the datasets
to which they apply and resource purpose "_other_"
(_ISOMetadataFile_ if the report is in ISO format).

Alternatively, a quality report distributed with the exchange set
may describe only the aggregated results along with a reference to
a location where the full results may be obtained.

Data Quality Measure Aggregation results should be computed to indicate
if the dataset/dataset series have passed the Product Specifications.
The elements which must be included are described in <<table_8.2>>
below.
